## 🎯 Overview

  

RecycleBin Forensic Explorer is a  user-friendly GUI application designed to quickly explore recycle bin from E01 forensic images for digital forensic investigators and cybersecurity professionals. This tool eliminates the complexity of manually parsing Windows Recycle Bin artifacts ($I and $R files) by providing an intuitive interface for quick browsing, analysis, and export of deleted file metadata.

  

### Why RecycleBin Forensic Explorer?

 
Traditional Recycle Bin forensics requires:

- ❌ Manual parsing of binary $I files for metadata extraction

- ❌ Complex command-line tools and scripts

- ❌ Matching $I files with corresponding $R files

- ❌ Time-consuming manual correlation of deleted file artifacts

  

**RecycleBin Forensic Explorer solves this by:**

- ✅ **One-click analysis** of entire Recycle Bin structures

- ✅ **Visual evidence tree** showing all deleted items instantly

- ✅ **Automatic $I/$R file parsing** with no manual intervention

- ✅ **Multiple export formats** (CSV, JSON, HTML reports)

- ✅ **Dark/Light mode** for comfortable analysis sessions

- ✅ **Detailed statistics** and timeline visualization

  

## 🚀 Key Features

## 📋 Forensic Metadata Extracted

  

| Field | Description |

|-------|-------------|

| **Original Filename** | Complete filename before deletion |

| **Original Path** | Full filesystem path where file resided |

| **Deletion Timestamp** | Exact date and time of deletion |

| **File Size** | Size in bytes of deleted file |

| **User SID** | Security Identifier of user who deleted file |

| **$I File Path** | Location of metadata file |

| **$R File Path** | Location of recoverable content file |

  

## 🔒 Forensic Soundness
